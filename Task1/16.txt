e public folder holds static assets that are served directly by the web server, such as images, icons, fonts, and files like favicon.ico. Anything in public can be accessed via a URL without being processed by the app’s code.

The separate app folder contains the application’s source code—components, pages, logic, and styles—that gets processed by the framework (Next.js) before being served. This separation ensures a clear distinction between raw static files and dynamic, interactive application code.
