The package.json file is a central configuration file for a Node.js project. It lists the project’s dependencies (libraries it relies on), scripts for running tasks (like starting the server or building the app), metadata (name, version, author), and configuration for tools. It’s significant because it ensures that everyone working on the project can install the exact same dependencies, run scripts consistently, and manage the project’s packages efficiently.
