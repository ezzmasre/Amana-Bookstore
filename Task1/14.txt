The index.ts file in the types folder defines TypeScript interfaces like Book, CartItem, and Review that describe the structure of data used in the app. These interfaces are imported into components and data files to ensure that objects have the correct fields, enable type-checking, and provide editor autocomplete, helping prevent errors and maintain consistency across the application.
